### Inside of this repository

The reader will encounter my solution to the homework assignment Pandas-challange. The repository is organized in folders and a README.md (The file you are currently reading). Here is the list of the folders and its contents so you can navigate through them.

1. Images: In this folder you will find the images for the instructions provided by the institution. *You can skip this folder if you want*.
2. HeroesOfPymoli: In this folder you will find all the solutions for the HeroesOfPymoli excercise. Insided the folder you will find two other folders and one ipynb file:
   * 1. Folder ''Resources'': This fodler contains the CSV files I used.
   * 2. Folder'.ipynb_checkpoints': This folder holds the check points to my file. *You can skip this folder if you want.*
   * The FinalMain.ipynb file contains my script solution to the excercise. Please download it before checking it, as in GitHub .ipynb files tend to not display properly when it comes to the style of the doc.
3. PyCitySchools In this folder you will find all the solutions for the PyCitySchools. Insided the folder you will find two other folders and one .ipynb file:
   * 1. Folder ''Resources'': This fodler contains the CSV files I used"analysis"": This folder holds my text file that has the results from my analysis.
     2. Folder'.ipynb_checkpoints': This folder holds the check points to my file. *You can skip this folder if you want.*
   * The FinalMain.ipynb file contains my script solution to the excercise. Please download it before checking it, as in GitHub .ipynb files tend to not display properly when it comes to the style of the doc.

I hope you find my work to not only be complete but displaying all the knowledge learned throughout this portion of the Data Science Bootcamp at Northwestern University.
